            Cyber security is the application of technologies, processes and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices and data from cyber <br>
<br>
            It aims to reduce the risk of cyber attacks and protect against the unauthorised exploitation of systems, networks and technologies <br>

            Who needs cyber security?<br>
            It is a mistake to believe that you are of no interest to cyber attackers. Everyone who is connected to the Internet needs cyber security. This is because most cyber attacks are automated and aim to exploit common vulnerabilities rather than specific websites or organisations.<br>
            Types of cyber threats<br>
Common cyber threats include:<br>
<br>
Malware, such as ransomware, botnet software, RATs (remote access Trojans), rootkits and bootkits, spyware, Trojans, viruses and worms.
Backdoors, which allow remote access.<br>
Formjacking, which inserts malicious code into online forms.<br>
Cryptojacking, which installs illicit cryptocurrency mining software.<br>
DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks, which flood servers, systems and networks with traffic to knock them offline.<br>
DNS (domain name system) poisoning attacks, which compromise the DNS to redirect traffic to malicious sites.<br>

What are the 5 types of cyber security?<br>
1. Critical infrastructure cyber security<br>
Critical infrastructure organisations are often more vulnerable to attack than others because SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) systems often rely on older software.<br>
<br>
Operators of essential services in the UKâ€™s energy, transport, health, water and digital infrastructure sectors, and digital service providers are bound by the NIS Regulations (Network and Information Systems Regulations 2018).<br>
<br>
Among other provisions, the Regulations require organisations to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage their security risks.<br>
<br>
2. Network security<br>
Network security involves addressing vulnerabilities affecting your operating systems and network architecture, including servers and hosts, firewalls and wireless access points, and network protocols.<br>
<br>

3. Cloud security<br>
Cloud security is concerned with securing data, applications and infrastructure in the Cloud.<br>
<br>
4. IoT (Internet of Things) security<br>
IoT security involves securing smart devices and networks that are connected to the IoT. IoT devices include things that connect to the Internet without human intervention, such as smart fire alarms, lights, thermostats and other appliances.<br>
<br>
5. Application security<br>
Application security involves addressing vulnerabilities resulting from insecure development processes in the design, coding and publishing of software or a website.<br>

Cyber security vs information security<br>
Cyber security is often confused with information security.<br>
<br>
Cyber security focuses on protecting computer systems from unauthorised access or being otherwise damaged or made inaccessible.<br>
Information security is a broader category that protects all information assets, whether in hard copy or digital form.<br>
